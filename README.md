# Webunits Calendar Colors

## Problem

Webunits is the primary program used for school timetable management in Austria. It is a web application where students can view their timetable and teachers can manage their classes. Updates to the timetable are automatically pushed to the students' devices which makes it very useful.

Special occurences like exams, events or rescheduled classes are marked with special colors. In the web application it looks something like this:

Since using the web application itself is a bit tedious, many people use a featue which allows them to export their timetable as a calendar url. This url can then be imported into any calendar application. This is what it looks like in the macOS calendar app:

As you can see, the extra color information is lost and replaced by information in square brackets. The aim of this little script is to get the color info back into the calendar app. Here is what it looks like after using the script:
